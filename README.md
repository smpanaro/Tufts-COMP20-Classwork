COMP20 - Stephen Panaro
=======================

## What is this repository for?
This is a repository containing my work for Tufts' [COMP20](http://cs.tufts.edu/comp/20/) class taught by [Ming Chow](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~mchow).  

## What's in here?
Each assignment is contained in its own folder. More details about the project can be found in the project README.  
**transit** - Parse MBTA data from an API and display subway lines and arrival times -- with geographically accurate mapping! Live [here](http://tuftsdev.github.io/comp20-spanaro/transit/).   
**2048-gamecenter/** - A client and server to save and serve [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) high scores.  
**security** - A security analysis of a classmate's 2048 GameCenter.
**duckhunt** - drawing duckhunt on an HTML5 canvas, resizably.  
**jobs** - Parse JSON and dynamically display it.  
**omfgdogs** - [omfgdogs](http://www.omfgdogs.com/) in HTML5.  
**status_updates** - Dynamically update the DOM from a text field and store information in localStorage.  

My favorite project for this class is also the one I'm most proud of. I made my transit project very fancy by parsing MBTA-provided data to provide geographically accurate subway routes. See it live [here](http://tuftsdev.github.io/comp20-spanaro/transit/). I've also uploaded the geojson I generated in the transit folder if you would like to use it.
