<h1>Security Assessment of 2048 GameCenter</h1>
<p>by Stephen Panaro</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to penetration test a fellow student's 2048 GameCenter. 2048 GameCenter is a web application developed to meet the requirements of <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/a4.html">COMP20 Assignment 4</a>. In short, the GameCenter accepts, stores and displays high scores from a <a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a> game. It provides an API to submit and retrieve scores for a specific user and also serves a web page displaying the high scores in the GameCenter.</p>

<p>I was assigned to test Sid Prasad's implementation, hosted at <a href="http://ancient-crag-7837.herokuapp.com/">http://ancient-crag-7837.herokuapp.com/</a></p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>First "black box" testing was performed. This testing is performed from the perspective of a malicious hacker who does not have legitimate access to any of the systems or source code being attacked. First, common attack vectors were tried, including script injection.</p>

<p>Next "white box" testing performed. This testing is performed by reviewing source code and application systems to look for potential weaknesses. Any insecurities that are discovered this way are then confirmed by using them against the actual application.</p>
